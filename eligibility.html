        <h1 class="headings">Hospice Eligibility</h1>
        <p>
            Advocate Hospice strives to provide excellent hospice and palliative care to eligible patients who benefit
            tremendously from hospice services. As such, we follow Medicare's Hospice Eligibility Guidelines to ensure
            that we provide the best outcome for patients, whether they come into our service or not. 
            <br><br>
            If you would like to determine if you or someone you know may qualify for hospice, Advocate Hospice has
            created the <a href="#assessment">Eligibility Assessment</a>: a short questionnaire (11 questions, for approximately 2-5 minutes) designed
            to indicate common qualifications for hospice eligibility. However, we have provided detailed information below which
            outlines illnesses that commonly qualify for hospice.
            <br><br>
            To be eligible for hospice, the patient must have a life expectancy of six (6) months or less to live. Commonly,
            if a patient has been diagnosed with a chronic condition or is suffering from a disease that does not respond to
            treatment, then there is ground for a hospice evaluation by a medical doctor. The following sections outline some
            of the common illnesses/diseases which may result in hospice:
        </p>

        <h2 class="no_display">Common Diagnoses for Hospice Eligibility</h2>
        <h3>Cancer Diagnoses</h3>
        <p>
            A cancer patient may have a life expectancy of six (6) months or less if they have distant metastases at presentation 
            <em>or</em> progression from an earlier stage of disease to metastatic disease with either:
            <ol>
                <li>a continued decline in spite of therapy</li>
                <li>the patient declining further disease directed therapy</li>
            </ol>

            What this means is that when cancer spread can no longer be controlled or when a patient no longer desires treatment,
            then hospice may be appropiate. Whether or not the patient comes onto hospice is up to them, or alternatively the <abbr>
            PoA</abbr> (Power of Attorney) if the patient is unable to consent.
            <br>
            <em>Note</em>: Certain cancers with poor prognoses (e.g. small cell lung cancer, brain cancer, and pancreatic cancer)
            may be hospice eligible without fulfilling the other criteria in this section.
        </p>
        <h3>Non-Cancer Diagnoses</h3>
        <p>
            The following section provides a list of common diseases/illnesses that commonly result in hospice eligibility:
            <ul>
                <li>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</li>
                <li>Dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders</li>
                <li>Heart Disease</li>
                <li>HIV Disease</li>
                <li>Liver Disease</li>
                <li>Pulmonary Disease</li>
                <li>Renal Disease (Acute renal failure or Chronic renal failure)</li>
                <li>Stroke & Coma</li>
                <li>Other
                    <ul>
                        <li>the hospice Medical Team must provide information that supports a terminal illness with a prognosis of six (6) months or less</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

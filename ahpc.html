                Advocate Hospice was started to promote excellent patient care at the end of life by Dr. Kevin Jackson
                and his spouse Barbara Jackson, who strive to provide outstanding and innovative patient care delivery.
                <br> Dr. and Mrs. Jackson previously owned and operated multiple medical agencies across Maricopa County
                since 2001, all sharing the goal of improving patient care in the Valley.
                Advocate Hospice is their latest creation with the philosophy of providing hospice care to eligible
                patients, sustaining the highest possible quality of life until death, and using their experience and
                expertise to deliver unrivaled hospice care.

            We believe that life should conclude naturally with a focus on quality of life in addition to the length of
            life. Also important to maintaining physical wellbeing is emotional and spiritual support which is shared
            with our patients and their families and caregivers.
            <br> Our team of professionals support the patient, their families and their loved ones, with the core
            belief being that each one of us has the right to die pain free and with dignity. Advocate Hospice promises
            to provide all of the support necessary to families' loved ones to accomplish this goal.

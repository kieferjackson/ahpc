            <p>
                Advocate Hospice was started to promote excellent patient care at the end of life by Dr. Kevin Jackson and his spouse Barbara Jackson, who strive to provide outstanding and innovative patient care delivery.
                <br> Dr. and Mrs. Jackson have previously owned and operated multiple medical practices across Maricopa County since 2001, all sharing the goal of improving patient care in the Valley.  
                Advocate Hospice is their latest creation with the philosophy of providing excellent palliative care, sustaining the highest possible quality of life until death, and using their experience and expertise to deliver unrivaled hospice care.

        <p>
            We believe that life should conclude naturally with a focus on quality of life rather than the length of life.  Also important to maintaining physical wellbeing is emotional and spiritual support, which we also offer to patients and their families.
            <br> Our team of professionals offer support to families and their loved ones, with the core belief being that each one of us has the right to die pain free and with dignity.  Advocate Hospice promises to provide all of the support necessary to families' loved ones to accomplish this goal.

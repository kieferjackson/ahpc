                "Would love to first say a million thanks to everyone involved in our mother's care in her last days, 
                if it weren't for Advocate Hospice we would have no idea what to do to help mom.
                <br>
                From Dr. Jackson to Monica and especially GayLynne were there thru the whole process and helped us 
                navigate and understand what was happening.
                <br>
                Also thank you Pastor Kristi."

                <br>
                It sounds like you guys had a sitter there with him when she wasn't? - she didn't even realize that at 
                the time but totally appreciates it now.
                <br>
                Thank you so much for your wonderful care and attention to details."

        <h2>Understanding whether hospice is right for you.</h2>
        <p>
            Part of hospice care is first determining whether or not it is the right option for the patient. Eligibility
            starts with a patient's attending physician or specialist who sends a referral order for the patient to
            hospice care.
            The hospice medical director determines if the patient has six months or less to live (if the illness runs
            its normal course) and approves the referral based on their evaluation of the patient's condition.
            Finally, the patient/caregiver signs a statement choosing hospice instead of other Medicare covered benefits
            that treat the illness.

        <h3>Hospice Care</h3>
        <p>
            The goal is to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life during terminal illness. When curative
            treatments are no longer working and/or a patient no longer desires to continue with them, hospice typically
            becomes the care of choice.</p>

        <h3>Palliative Care</h3>
        <p>
            This care can be provided at any time during the course of an illness and in conjunction with curative,
            aggressive treatments and skilled nursing care.</p>

        <h2 class="headings">FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Under hospice care, what happens if a patient lives longer than 6 months?</h3>
        <p>If the patient continues to meet the hospice criteria, then the patient will continue to receive hospice
            services.</p>

        <h3>What happens if the patient's condition improves?</h3>
        <p>If the patient's condition improves to the point where hospice services are no longer needed, then the
            patient will be discharged from services.</p>

        <h3>What happens in an emergency?</h3>
        <p>Advocate Hospice has on-call nurses 24/7.</p>

        <h3>When is a decision made to come on hospice? And who should make it?</h3>
        <p>At any time during a life-limiting illness, it is appropriate to discuss all of the patient's care options.
            By law, the decision belongs to the patient. If they are unable, then it is up to the power of the attorney.
        </p>

        <h3>Does hospice do anything to make death come sooner?</h3>
        <p>Hospice neither hastens nor postpones dying.</p>

                "Would love to first say a million thanks to everyone involved in our mother's care in her last days, 
                if it weren't for Advocate Hospice we would have no idea what to do to help mom.
                <br>
                From Dr. Jackson to Monica and especially GayLynne were there thru the whole process and helped us 
                navigate and understand what was happening.
                <br>
                Also thank you Pastor Kristi."

                "Just wanted to let you know "S" just called to say thank you and let me know how wonderful all of your 
                Advocate Hospice staff were with "C".
                <br>
                It sounds like you guys had a sitter there with him when she wasn't? - she didn't even realize that at 
                the time but totally appreciates it now.
                <br>
                Thank you so much for your wonderful care and attention to details."
